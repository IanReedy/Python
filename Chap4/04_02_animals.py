"""
I create a list called `anims` containing 'dog', 'cat', and 'hyeana'. 
Then, I use a for loop to iterate over each animal and print a specific message based on the type of animal. 
If the animal is a 'dog', I mention it's a man's best friend; for a 'cat', I comment on its social behavior; and for a 'hyeana', I note that it's a very dangerous animal.

    elif anim == 'cat':
        print("My " + anim + " isn't very social.")
