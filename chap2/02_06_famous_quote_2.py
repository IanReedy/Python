I assign the string "Walt Disney" to the variable `famous_person`. 
Then, I print a message that combines `famous_person` with the quote: 
"The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.", resulting in: 
"Walt Disney once said “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”".
