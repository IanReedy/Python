"""
I assign the integer 50 to the variable `favNum`. 
Then, I print a formatted string that includes the value of `favNum` using an f-string, resulting in: "My favorite number is 50". 
Without the f before the string, `favNum` would not be replaced with its value, and the output would be: "My favorite number is {favNum}".

favNum = 50
print (f"My favorite number is {favNum}")
#without the f before the string favNum will not print properly
