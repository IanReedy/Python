I assign the string 'honda' to the variable `car`. 
I print a statement predicting that `car` is equal to 'honda' and then evaluate this expression, which returns True. 
Next, I print a statement predicting that `car` is equal to 'audi' and evaluate the expression, but mistakenly check if `car` is equal to an empty string, which returns False.
