"""
I check the ages of six different individuals using a series of conditional statements to determine their life stages based on the following criteria: 
- If the age is less than 2, they are a baby. 
- If the age is between 2 and 4, they are a toddler. 
- If the age is between 4 and 13, they are a kid. 
- If the age is between 13 and 20, they are a teenager. 
- If the age is between 20 and 65, they are an adult. 
- If the age is greater than 65, they are an elder. 
For each age (`age1`, `age2`, `age3`, `age4`, `age5`, `age6`), I print the corresponding life stage.
