"""
In this code, I am trying to print "Hello World" to the console, but there's a typo. 
I forgot to add the closing quotation mark after "World", causing a syntax error.
To fix this, I would need to add the missing quotation mark at the end, like this: print("Hello World").
"""


print("Hello World)
      # To fix you would have to put the finishing  " after "World"
