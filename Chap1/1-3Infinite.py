If i had infinite programming skills I would like to program a game from scratch. I'm thinking of doing game and sim because I think it sounds fun. Also I might 
want to create a few apps that would be useful to me. For example, a really easy one would be on either on phone or pc, that could count clicks or taps on the screen. 
Another app that sound like fun to make is something that tracks keys people press. I'm not sure how hard an antivirus would be but making one of those would be nice too.
